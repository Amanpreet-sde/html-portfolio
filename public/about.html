<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Amanpreet Singh, a 21-year-old web development enthusiast from Dehradun, Uttarakhand. Currently pursuing my graduation, I am fervently working towards a career in web development. I am actively expanding my knowledge through Dr. Angela Yuâ€™s Udemy course, which is equipping me with essential skills for creating dynamic and engaging websites. Despite being at the beginning of my journey, I have already applied my learning by building two HTML projects: "My Top 3 Movies of All Time" and "Birthday Invitation." These projects reflect my growing proficiency and creativity in web design. I am passionate about further developing my skills and eager to contribute to exciting web development opportunities as I continue to advance in my career.</p>
